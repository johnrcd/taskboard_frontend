# Taskboard

**Rovi's Taskboard** is a full stack website for giving me tasks to do. These tasks can be ideas for games, songs, or any projects I'm working on; features for anything that's already up and running, or issues that need to be fixed.

The website can be viewed here:

## frontend details

The frontend was created using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

There's also some other packages I used -- they're not that important but I figured I'd mention them in case I need to see what packages I was using before.

- javascript-time-ago/react-time-ago: Converts dates to "time from now" text (e.g. 45s, 15 minutes ago, 3 hours ago)
- react-icons: General-purpose icons. Currently, I'm just using it for the hamburger menu icon.
